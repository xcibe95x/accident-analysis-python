# Reducing Major Accidents in UK analysis 2020

I applied with no prior python knowledge to the competition in reducing UK Major accidents.
I finished the competition 11th, and learned a lot during the process.
When i first opened jupiter notebook i didn't know where to start from.
I read a lot of documentations and finally i completed my entry.
